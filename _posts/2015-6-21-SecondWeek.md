title: Second Week of CS373
---

This second week of classes continued very much like the first week, with some of the topics discussed going over general knowledge things and some topics being themed towards the next project that is due. The general knowledge topics covered operations and recursion, and how they are implemented or used in each language. It is very cool to see the differences in implementation for the two languages one after the other because you can get a real feel for how one language may be more optimal for a certain function. On Friday, the code that was looked at in class had to do with the RMSE (root mean squared error) which is what we have to use in our Netflix project. I think that it is great that Professor Downing does this because it gives you a place to start in the project if you do not know what to do first; looking at the many different ways to implement the RMSE also lets you optimize your code in case you already knew what to do and had a less efficient method. 

The class continues to be very engaging and there are even some breaks in the lecture where we are encouraged to partner up to discuss some code. These moments are nice to make new friends and see how others might approach a problem. Quizzes are still not going as well as I would like, but it's not that they are hard. The quizzes are very fair and basically test if you have read or paid attention in class. The answer is usually very straight forward, but sometimes I miss the little details like a value being true/false. 


Tip of the Week:
If you are using Google Chrome, there is a cool extension that you can add called WebDeveleoper which among other things, allows you to see the JavaScript that the website uses.
