title: Fourth Week of CS373
---

Monday was the first midterm for this class so I spent a good portion of the weekend going over material in preparation. For the exam, we were allowed one piece of papers worth of notes with the restriction of no code, but I wasn’t sure what to put on my paper so I didn’t bring one. Despite this I felt the exam was not too difficult, and was entirely fair based on the lessons and the review provided. I also have a better idea of what to expect on the second exam which I hope to do better on.

After the exam, the focus was put on the next project which would consist of 3 phases, the first of which would be due next Tuesday. Finding a group was not too difficult and I am very happy with my group members. We met for the first time on Friday and came up with the idea of making a website with marketplace functionality for Dota2 because there is currently not a good website for this purpose. I love this idea because I have some familiarity with the game and it is a legitimately useful idea. My group members are also impressive because each has loads of experience with the tools we will be using, from their own personal projects;  I expect to learn a lot from them.

Tip of the Week:
I followed the instructions on the piazza post in order to allow ssh access to the Rackspace server and found this list for vi commands to be very helpful
