title: Third Week of CS373
---

This week started out with me trying to finish up the Netflix project in time for the Tuesday deadline. It was an interesting project because we were expected to implement an algorithm that would win the Netflix prize. This meant having a RMSE (root means squared error) of less than 1.00, which was calculated using our predicted customer ratings vs the actual ratings the customer gave to each movie. I was unable to get a partner for this project but I still managed to get my RMSE to 0.97 using some advice from Piazza. It was difficult to do without someone to bounce ideas off of, but not impossible and from this project I can see the value in pair programming.

On Wednesday, Everett Toews  from Rackspace came to teach the class how to set up an account and make a VM on Rackspace. The VM will be used in the next 3 projects for this class and I am particularly excited for these because the end product is a website with imdb-like functionality. He also talked about life lessons at the request of Professor Downing during which he emphasized attitude > tech. It was very helpful to hear his advice and I am going to try to apply some of what I heard to my own life. 

Finally, we learned some details for the test on Monday which I feel I am not ready for. I think I understand everything that has been taught in class but it does not reflect in my grades and I am afraid that I will do equally bad on the test.  



Tip of the Week:
It's a bit late now but I managed to find the textbooks online
