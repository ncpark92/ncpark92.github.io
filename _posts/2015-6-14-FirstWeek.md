title: First Week of CS373
---

CS373 has exceeded my expectations of what kind of class it will be. On Friday, which was the first of classes for us, we went over the syllabus and learned of the expectations in the class. The professor is very strict in his requirements but they aren’t unreasonable. He seems to genuinely care about his students and even takes time to learn people’s names when they ask questions. Something that stuck out from that first day of class was Professor Downing saying that we should not be in this class and that we should be in a summer internship at a great company instead; that we should not be trying to rush out of school or catching up by doing summer school, but rather taking this time to put good experience in internships on our resume. 

Each class after that has been him going over some code and trying to understand of concepts like assertions and exceptions. I find this class much easier to pay attention to than almost any other class I have taken at UT which is very surprising to me. This is probably due to the teaching style that Professor Downing employs where he calls on people to answer questions as he leads the discussion. We were assigned some readings for homework for the class and those readings were focused on how to get the most out of college. They were interesting reads and I will have to try to keep them in mind as I finish out this class. 

The class is called Software Engineering which sounds incredibly scary and hard but it has been very forgiving so far in prior knowledge required. I have worked on my project for most of this weekend and my lack of experience in Python has not been too much trouble.  On the other hand, these quizzes are giving me trouble when they shouldn't be. They haven't been particularly difficult but I have not been scoring as high as I would like and will need to figure them out quickly in order to get the grade I want. 


Tip of the Week:
Go to class.
I think it was quoted recently by Professor Downing that 80% of success is showing up and I feel that this is especially true for this class because of the way Professor Downing teaches. In class, you can ask questions directly to the professor and get good examples of what we are expected to know for the class.
